# Re/Sculpture Web App

This project is an interactive web application created for the **Re/Sculpture** exhibition at the **Nouveau Mus√©e Bienne (NMB)** in collaboration with the **University of Bern, Institute of Art History**.
The application is developed using Svelte, incorporating JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, along with the MapLibre library for enhanced mapping functionalities.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source files for the project.
  - **`routes/`**: Reusable Svelte components.
    - **`+pages.svelte`**: Acts as a parent component with one of the three map variations (Map.svelte, MapNew.svelte and MapOld.svelte).
    - **`Map.svelte`**: The main map containing old and new information about the sculptures.
    - **`Popup.svelte`**: Handles the components that show sculpture information. It is a child component of all map variants.
    - **`Slideshow.svelte`**: Handles the slideshow of images for the sculptures with more than one image to be displayed inside the Popup component. It is a child of the popup component.
- **`static/`**: Static assets such as images and fonts.
